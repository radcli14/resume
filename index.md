## Objective

I'm a mobile application developer with a background in mechanical engineering and over 10 years of experience in aerospace R&D. 
I specialize in building interactive apps that combine real-world physics with immersive 3D and augmented reality (AR) experiences, and am passionate about simulation and analysis of moving mechanical systems. 
I develop for iOS using Swift and RealityKit, and I'm also experienced in building multiplatform applications for Android using Jetpack Compose. 
My 3D development background includes tools like Blender and Three.js, enabling me to deliver cross-platform AR and 3D visualization experiences for mobile, desktop, and web.
