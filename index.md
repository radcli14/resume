## Objective

Seeking leadership opportunities in an entrepreneurial or startup environment, where I will apply over a decade of mechanical and aerospace engineering experience, alongside a unique software application development skillset.
I am passionate about modeling and simulation of moving mechanical assemblies, and 3-D design and rendering of those systems on novel platforms, including mobile devices.
<!--- Pursuing opportunities to create mobile application content and improve my technical abilities in the Swift and Kotlin programming languages. 
My professional goal is to transition from a mechanical to software engineering career.
A long term personal goal is to apply these skills to bringing education-grade engineering and physics applications to the masses using mobile platforms. --->
