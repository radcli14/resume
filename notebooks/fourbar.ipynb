Assuming units of kilograms ($kg$), meters ($m$), Newtons ($N$), and seconds ($s$), the gravitational acceleration is specified to be 9.81 $m/s^2$. For this model, we will assume links of length 1, 2, 3, and 4 $m$, respectively, and with mass value of 1, 2, and 3 $kg$ for the first 3 links (the fourth link is fixed to the ground, it is not assigned mass).

    "Python and the `sympy`, `numpy`, and `scipy` modules are used to derive equations of motion and simulate the motion of a four bar linkage mechanism. The derivation includes the definition of symbolic variables, frames to define angular orientation, points to define position, and positional constraints. Rigid bodies are defined with mass and inertia defined at the center of each link, and gravitational force is applied at the mass centers. Kane's method is used to derive equations of motion, which are subsequently simulated, and the results plotted for generalized coordinates, speeds, and link positions as a function of time."
