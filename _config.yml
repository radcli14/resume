about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Seeking opportunities in an entrepreneurial or startup environment, where I will apply over a decade of mechanical and aerospace engineering experience, alongside a unique software application development skillset.
  I am passionate about simulation and analysis of moving mechanical systems, and 3-D design and visualization on novel platforms, including mobile devices.

          The first multibody dynamics app for iOS and Android
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          MOMDYN provides an easy to use graphical interface that is familiar to engineers and physicists who have studied classical mechanics, with a powerful set of features similar to modern modeling and simulation software. 
          The software forms a bridge between the”first-principles” approach to dynamics problem solving, and the modern approach using advanced (and expensive) commercial software applications.
